        <h3>About Lydia</h3>
        <p>Hey, I'm Lydia. I'm 21, I love pugs & I'm from Massachusetts.
          <br><br>
          My love for calligraphy began as the result of my inability to pay attention in class. Though I've been making things for people since high school, I "officially" began <span class="logo-font">Callydgraphy</span> November of 2015 while I was recovering from my ACL surgery. Since then, I've been able to work on a wide variety of commissions, ranging from seating charts on mirrors, wedding programs on chalkboards, personal greeting cards, wedding invitations, vow books, and more. It's been a blast so far, and I look forward to helping you put to paper (or mirror or chalkboard or whatever) exactly what you want! </p>
